- Hi, I’m Sebastian Lim
- I’m interested in Data Analytics and Engineering.
- Currently working at HSBC to migrate data and finance operating model from legacy systems to Google Cloud Platform.  
- I’m studying the IBM Data Science course on Coursera to broaden my knowledge on technical tools such as Python NumPy.
- I'm hoping to expand my GitHub profile with any upcoming projects that I will be working on.
- Feel free to reach out at sebastianlim@hotmail.co.uk
